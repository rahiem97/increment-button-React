[Description] This simple react application Used the create-react-act boiler plate with minor modifications to create a button that incremenets a counter in a functional and class component.

[App.js] contains a functional component that returns the page layout. A nested function called FunctionalCounter() uses count and setCount hooks to save the counter data and update it as the onClick listener is regertered on the button. This number is not saved and will reset as the page is refreshed. 

[index.js] has a class component version of this increment button. The class uses this.state and this.setState to update the text as the onClick listener is registered on the button.

This is the bulk of the functionality and was used to understand functional and class components.
